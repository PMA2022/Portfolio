So let's talk about robotics. In my opinion it is the best club to participate in because you build a robot with metal and big machines. It is not something that you can complete in one day like a lego set. It takes many months of prototyping, testing and modeling. I decided to go into a little more depth here and explain the situation. At this time, I am starting to think about college admissions and where I would like to attend school. 



Side by side comparison:
Both teams are fun to participate in, and both coaches are friendly. They both also are somewhat small, so everyone has something to do during the build day.

Its crazy how this image was taken one year ago to date.
