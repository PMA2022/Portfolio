&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whoever is reading this website, I would like to say thank you for checking this out. Since you clicked on the "Why SMU" portion of my website, you must be very interested (I hope) as to why I want to attend SMU. To start this wild adventure we first need to start all the way from the beginning (ninth grade).


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sixth grade, I moved to a small school in Florida called Windermere Preparatory School. Skipping ahead a few years to 9th grade, there was a college fair that was supposed to be for sophomores and juniors. Yet, my parents really wanted me to attend so I talked to my high school counselor to see if there was a way that I could attend. Luckily there were some available spots, so my counselor was able to sign me up.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was walking into the college fair, I had no idea what to expect. It really hadn't dawned on me that college was right around the corner. I wasn't thinking about which college I wanted to attend. I knew that I wanted to study engineering, and I knew that I wanted to go to a good school in Texas. I ended up running into the SMU booth. At the time I wasn't able to pinpoint why the name was vaguely familiar so I headed over to the table to meet Mrs. Morris.
