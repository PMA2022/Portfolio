Welcome to a list with some of my activities throughout high school.

In 9th grade I did soccer and swimming. In 10th grade I did tennis and robotics. In 11th grade I swam again and I did robotics as well as debate. Senior year I will be swimming and doing robotics.


That is about it. It is a very short list.
